*	Our next goal will be to set up drawing a grid as the window's background.
*	Our first idea is to use the `wxCustomBackgroundWindow` class to tile a bitmap of a grid all over the window's background.
*	Simple grid drawing code which first paints a white background, and then a couple of equidistant grey lines. It seems to work great.
