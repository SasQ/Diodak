*	Subgoal: Parts list with icons and labels.
*	We use `wxListCtrl` for the parts list.
*	For now we simply add some items to the list with the simplest metod there is: parametrized `InsertItem` method.
	There is no image list attached yet, so there are no icons, just simple text labels.

PROBLEMS:
*	After adding the image list, from some unknown reasons two clicks are needed to change the tab in the tabbed notebook. This needs fixin'.

TODO:
*	Add icon images using `wxImageList`.
*	Correct the "two clicks to switch a tab" bug, if possible.
