*	Our next goal is to create the layout for the main window (frame).
*	Switching to splitters.
*	This time we use a `wxSplitterWindow` to lay out child windows in a horizontal row, all stretched to always fit the entire client area.
	The splitter is a lone child window, so it is stretched to cover the entire client area of the frame.
	But it manages two child windows in a horizontal split view, with the vertical sash between them being able to move left or right.
	It then automatically resizes its child windows.
*	We set the minimal size of the pane to 100 pixels to prevent the sidebar from being too small.
	Unfortunately, this also disallows removing the sidebar entirely by double-clicking on the splitter's sash.
*	Double-clicking to remove one of the panes wouldn't work properly anyway, because it removes its right child window by default.
	We would rather like the left child (the sidebar) to hide.
	Unfortunately there's no obvious way to set up which one of the child windows should disappear when double-clicking the sash.
	We would have to override its `OnUnsplit` or `OnDoubleClickSash` member functions to handle it manually to just hide the sidebar.
	We will try it next time.

TODO:
*	Allow for hiding the sidebar by double-clicking the vertical splitter's sash.
