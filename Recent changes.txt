*	Drawing a grid as the window's background.
*	Our first idea is to use the `wxCustomBackgroundWindow` class to tile a bitmap of a grid all over the window's background.
*	Better grid drawing code which draws a nicer grid with three different scales.
	The code is parametrized, which allows for more flexibility and the code can now be factored out more easily.
	We'll do that factoring later.

PROBLEMS:
*	The grid is painted incorrectly in the damaged regions, because it doesn't seem to account for the scrolled position.
	Instead, it always draws the grid precisely at the same place in the window's background.
	The way to correct this is to overwrite the Erase or Paint event and call `DoPrepareDC` on the device context before drawing the bitmap.
	But this would undermine the whole idea of using `wxCustomBackgroundWindow`, since we would have to draw the background ourselves anyway.
	This means that we can as well switch to that method instead.

TODO:
*	Factor out the grid drawing code.
*	Switch to hand-drawing the background.
