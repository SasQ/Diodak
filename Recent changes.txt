*	Our next goal is to create the layout for the main window (frame).
*	We add a simple sidebar (just a `wxPanel` for now) on the left of the circuit view.
*	Added further standard parameters to the `CircuitView`'s constructor to be able to set this window's position and size.

PROBLEMS:
*	When there's only one single child window in the frame, its size and position are ignored.
	The window is being stretched to fit the entire client area of the frame and resizes with it.
	But when there's more child windows than one (as in our case), their sizes and positions are not managed any longer.
	Their size and position are being taken from their constructors and they are static.
	We want a fluid layout, so we need to use some better method for managing these child windows.

TODO:
*	Find a better way to manage child windows' sizes and positions automatically.
