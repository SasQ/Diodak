*	Simplest scrollable window using `wxScrolledWindow` (an alias for `wxScrolled<wxPanel>`).
*	We set its scrollbars by Method 2: setting the virtual size and then the scroll rate directly.
*	Note how the window's initial size and position from the constructor are being ignored, and the
	scrolled window is automatically stretched to always fit the whole client area of the frame.
	This is the default behavior if there's only one child window in the frame.
