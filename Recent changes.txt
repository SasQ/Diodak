*	Subgoal: Parts list with icons and labels.
*	We use `wxListCtrl` for the parts list.
*	Attached an image list to get a nice-looking icons. The images are stored in `src/assets/Parts/Gates`.

PROBLEMS:
*	Unfortunately, the icons aren't very nice-looking :-P
	1.	There's a wide gap between the icon and its caption. This might confuse the user that the caption rather belongs to the next icon.
		Seems as if the height of the area reserved for the icon is taken to be the same as the image's width.
		But still the image is aligned to top instead to bottom, which makes this wide gap.
	2.	All images in the `wxImageList` have to be of the same size.
		If some image has a different size, wxWidgets shows an ugly message box with an error from somewhere inside the library.
	3.	The list is being aligned in columns first, instead of in rows first.
	4.	When there's not enough room vertically, it wraps to the next column.
		But when there's not enough room horizontally, it shows a scrollbar.
		I'd rather like it the other way around:
		Order the icons in rows, wrap these rows when there's not enough room horizontally, and show the vertical scrollbar when out of vertical space.
	5.	An ugly dotted rectangle is shown around the label of the item which has been selected last time even if no item is selected.
	6.	Selected icon doesn't change; only the caption's background color.
		It would look better if it outlined or changed the background color of both the icon and its caption when selected.
	Seems like we need some custom drawing for this control, or to use a completely different control.
*	After adding the image list, from some unknown reasons two clicks are needed to change the tab in the tabbed notebook. This needs fixin'.

TODO:
*	Correct the "two clicks to switch a tab" bug, if possible.
