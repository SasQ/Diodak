*	Drawing a grid as the window's background.
*	The `wxCustomBackgroundWindow` idea has been dropped completely.
	Switched to a custom control derived from `wxScrolledWindow` for drawing the circuit view.
	It has been put in a separate module `Views/Circuit`, for more clarity, easier maintenance and separate compilation.
*	The grid drawing code has been moved to that module, too, since it will be mostly used in there.
	Now it's being called from the circuit view window's Erase event.
*	The `Makefile` has been updated to account for the new `Views/Circuit` module.

PROBLEMS:
*	The grid is still painted incorrectly in the damaged regions, because it doesn't seem to account for the scrolled position.
	Instead, it always draws the grid precisely at the same place in the window's background.
	Next time we'll try to correct this by calling `DoPrepareDC` on the device context before drawing the bitmap.

TODO:
*	Factor out the grid drawing code some more.
*	Correct the grid drawing to account for the scrolled view.
