*	Our next goal is to create the layout for the main window (frame).
*	Switching to a fluid layout employing Sizers.
*	We use a `wxBoxSizer` to lay out child windows in a horizontal row, all stretched to always fit the entire client area.
	We set the sidebar's proportion to 0, which means that it won't use any excess horizontal space (that is, won't stretch beyond its usual size).
	Circuit view, on the other hand, has the proportion set to 1, which means that it will use the entire excess horizontal space and stretch to fit it.
	Both child windows will stretch vertically to fit the client area of the parent window.
*	Then we call `SetSizerAndFit` to tell the frame to use our sizer for layout and update it when resizing,
	and that it should never be resizd to be smaller than the minimal sizes of all its children taken together
	(that is, its client area should always fit to the sizer, so it won't resize any smaller if the sizer is already at its minimal size).

PROBLEMS:
*	Unfortunately, this won't allow the user to resize the sidebar when needed.
	We'll try a better approach with a sizing splitter next time.
