*	Our next goal is to create the basic layout for the main window (frame).
*	Switched to splitters.
*	Added a tabbed notebook in the sidebar (just for testing).
*	Corrected one minor bug in `Circuit.hh` to make it backward-compatible with wxWidgets 2.8.

PROBLEMS:
*	When the sidebar contains a tabbed notebook, the mouse cursor doesn't change when hovering over the splitter's sash.
*	There's some ugly oogaboogah with the grid when compiling against wxWidgets 2.8. It needs fixing.

TODO:
*	Allow for hiding the sidebar by double-clicking the vertical splitter's sash.
