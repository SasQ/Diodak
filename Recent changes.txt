*	Our next goal will be to set up drawing a grid as the window's background.
*	Our first idea is to use the `wxCustomBackgroundWindow` class to tile a bitmap of a grid all over the window's background.
	We'll write the grid drawing code in the next iteration. This time we just use some random bitmap, as a proof of concept.
